    <div style="text-align:center"><img  src="starrk.jpg" title="Coyote Starrk" ></div>
        <p style="text-align:center">Front Look</p>
    <h2><a name="appearance"><b>Appearance</b></a></h2>
    <p>
        Starrk has blue-gray eyes and wavy, dark brown hair, which ends at the base of his neck, is always unkempt, and is parted down the middle. <br />
        He has a faded goatee. His clothing is typical of an Arrancar: he wears a white jacket outlined in black, though altered with the collar upturned. <br />
        A black sash is worn in a manner similar to a matador around his waist and he wears white gloves. <br />
        The remains of his Hollow mask consist of a fanged bottom jaw which is positioned along his neck. <br />
        His Hollow hole is on his sternum, right below the tip of his mask. <br />
        His Espada tattoo is featured on the back of his left hand, which he conceals with his glove. <br />
    </p>
    <h2><a name="personality"><b>Personality</b></a></h2>
    <p>
        Starrk is a lazy and unenthusiastic man who spends much of his time asleep, and no one, except Lilynette Gingerbuck, his other half, <br />
        appears to try and stop him from doing so.Despite being the highest-ranking Espada, he is not eager to take a leadership role, <br />
        allowing Baraggan Louisenbairn to take over at the battle of the Fake Karakura Town. He is not particularly interested in whatever is going on around him, <br />
        though he is observant and a capable analyst.  Unlike many of the Espada, he is not inherently violent or overly arrogant. <br />
        <br />
        Prior to meeting Aizen, Starrk hated the loneliness he felt in the world but often could not avoid it because his mere presence killed off others around him. <br />
        He envied the weak and wanted to be like them because they could travel in groups.Eventually he felt so lonely that he divided his soul <br />
        into two separate beings to escape his solitude. From there he continued to search for friends until he met Aizen. <br />
        Despite having gained many comrades after joining Aizen, he rarely directly addresses any of them other than Lilynette. <br />
        <br />
        He initially does not seem to care a great deal for his fellow Espada, showing no visible signs of distress or concern. <br />
        When he learns of Aaroniero Arruruerie's death, he lazily states there is nothing he could do about it, <br />
        and when Baraggan and Tier Harribel are apparently overwhelmed by their opponents' respective Bankai, he only asks Shunsui Kyōraku if all the captains' Bankai are so powerful.<br />
        However, this indifferent attitude seems to be dispelled with Baraggan's death. Starrk states Sōsuke Aizen not sparing even a word for Baraggan is horrible.<br />
        Starrk himself is notably affected by this turn of events, being drained of his motivation to fight. <br />
         After arguing with Lilynette for a while, he states he is not the type for revenge, but his desire to not see any more comrades die proves to be enough motivation for him to keep fighting. <br />
        Starrk seems to be opposed to the notion of killing people, offering Love Aikawa and Rōjūrō Ōtoribashi a chance to run away instead of finishing them off. <br />
    </p>
    <h2><a name="history"><b>History</b></a></h2>
    <p>
        Starrk tried to live with other Hollows, but simply being near him caused them to lose their souls and die.Because of this, <br />
        he became jealous of how the weak are allowed to come together, and so wanted to become weak. <br />
        In an attempt to escape his loneliness, he split his soul into two when he became an Arrancar, <br />
        unlike most Arrancar who divide their powers into a Zanpakutō, which became himself and Lilynette Gingerbuck. <br />
        Not remembering which of them originally resembled themselves before they split, Starrk suspected their original appearance corresponded to neither of them. <br />
        Even so, Starrk wanted to become weak so he could be together with a group, and if this were not possible, he wanted to find someone as strong as him. <br />
        <br />
        When he split his soul, he asked the newly formed Arrancar if she had a name. <br />
        Telling him her name was Lilynette, she asked if he had a name, despite them being the same person. <br />
        Telling her his, he threw her a cloth to wrap herself up in. As she asked him what would they do now, he stated they could do anything. <br />
        When she asked where would they go, he, stating they could go anywhere, assured Lilynette no matter what, they would stick together forever. <br />
